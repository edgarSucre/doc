# Union Find (disjoint set)

Union Find is a data structure that keeps track of elements which are split into one or more disjoint
sets. It has two primary operations `Find` and `Union`.

## Use Cases
- Kruskal's minimum spanning tree
- Grid percolation (checks if there's a path from bottom to top of the grid or vice versa by merging paths)
- Network connectivity
- Least common ancestor in trees
- Image processing*
